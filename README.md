## .... 6-8 hours ....

![wtf](https://c.tenor.com/FFr1O0TsBzsAAAAC/coffee.gif)

So I went a path of SCSS modules for grid/layout and some static classes spit out globally, and a bunch of custom components. No third party UI library. Obviously didn't get everything I wanted completed.
Now, i get the 6-8 hours if I had something ready, or an available stack. If it was my choice i'd just have went with apollo on nextjs. Solves a lot of these propblems.

So it,s next with redux and a few custom solutions in branches.

# SetUp
- Nextjs
- Typescript
- SASS
- Redux

# Time
- Monday - Some base and research
- Tuesday - N/A 
- Wednesday - Some styles and polling demo
